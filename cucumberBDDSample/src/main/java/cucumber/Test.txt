Subject: Request for Employment Verification Letter

Dear Vijay Tyagi,

I am writing to request an employment verification letter, also known as an experience letter, to confirm my employment tenure and details with Scotiabank.

Could you please provide me with a letter that includes the following details:

- Dates of employment
- Job title(s) held
- Brief description of job responsibilities
- Reason for leaving (optional)

I would appreciate it if you could provide this letter at your earliest convenience. If there are any additional steps or documentation required from my end, please let me know.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Sincerely,
Ashok Sagi
