**Subject:** Urgent: Testing Blocked in SIT Environment

---

Hello Team,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to inform you that the SIT environment was down yesterday from 1 PM EST to 5:15 PM EST due to a login page issue. Unfortunately, as soon as this issue was resolved, a new problem emerged where we were unable to fetch company records from the search box in CPtools.

We have created a relops for the same but closed it without actually resolving the issue [RELOPS-126845] CPtools-SIT - Not able to search company in UI - Merrill Lynch.

The issue persists and is being tracked as part of this relops [RELOPS-126848] SIT CP TOOL: Company Profile page not loading - Merrill Lynch.

The SIT environment has proven to be highly unstable, causing us to miss all our deadlines. We are unable to re-test a bug or assist our team in troubleshooting the issue. This has been ongoing for almost a week, and there is no resolution in sight.

Our team has been sacrificing personal time and working late to check if the system is operational so that we can test and close at least one or two bugs. 

If this situation continues, we will be unable to complete the testing within the already missed timelines.

Your immediate attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
Ashok Sharma
